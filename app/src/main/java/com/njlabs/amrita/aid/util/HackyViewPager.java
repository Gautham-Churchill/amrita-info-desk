/**
 * Hacky fix for Issue #4 and
 * http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=18990
 * <p/>
 * ScaleGestureDetector seems to mess up the touch events, which means that
 * ViewGroups which make use of onInterceptTouchEvent throw a lot of
 * IllegalArgumentException: pointerIndex out of range.
 * <p/>
 * There's not much I can do in my code for now, but we can mask the result by
 * just catching the problem and ignoring it.
